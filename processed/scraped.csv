If you don’t know the person, or aren’t sure you will get what you paid for (for example, items bought from an online bidding or sales site), you should not use Zelle®. These transactions are potentially high risk (just like sending cash to a person you don’t know is high risk).

Find more info on using Zelle® securely here.Are there any limits for sending and receiving money with Zelle®?There are no limits to how much money you can receive with Zelle®; however, keep in mind that the person sending you money may have limits set by their own financial institutions.

The minimum you can send is $1.Can I cancel a payment?You can only cancel a payment if the person you sent money to hasn’t yet enrolled with Zelle®. To check whether the payment is still pending because the recipient hasn’t yet enrolled, you can go to your activity page, choose the payment you want to cancel and then select “Cancel This Payment.” If you do not see this option available, please contact us via Chat for assistance with cancelling the pending payment. If the person you sent money to has already enrolled with Zelle®, the money is sent directly to their bank account and can’t be canceled. That’s why it’s important to send money only to people you trust, and always be sure you’ve used the correct email address or U.S. mobile number when sending money. If you sent money to the wrong person, we recommend contacting the recipient and requesting the money back. If you aren’t able to get your money back, please contact us via Chat from your Varo app so we can help you. Scheduled or recurring payments sent directly to your recipient’s account number (instead of an email address or U.S. mobile number) are made available by Varo but are a separate service from Zelle® and can take one to three business days to process.

Another round of stimulus checks (also called economic impact payments) are being issued by the federal government. You’ll get a stimulus check if you meet these four requirements: You have a Social Security number. You are a legal U.S. resident. You have adjusted gross income up to $87,000 as a single tax filer or $174,000 as a married couple. You’re not being claimed as a dependent on someone else’s 2019 tax return. This is the second round of federal payments. If you’re still waiting on your first payment under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act from March, you may still be eligible. Read more on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website. If you were not required to file taxes, you’re still eligible to receive money if you fit the above criteria. How much money will I get? If you made less than $75,000 ($150,000 for married couples) on your 2020 tax return and were not claimed as a dependent by someone else, you’ll be eligible for $600. If you made between $75,000 and $87,000 on your most recently reported income year, you’ll receive a reduced payment. Families with children 16 or under will receive an additional $600 for each child who qualifies. How will I get my stimulus check and when will it arrive? The government will send you the money via direct deposit or check based on the method you chose in your most recent tax filing. Please check the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website frequently for updates related to the current economic stimulus payments. Direct Deposit Most people will receive their payment via an ACH direct deposit to the bank account where they receive their SSI, SSA, or other payments, such as a tax refund from the IRS. Paper check If you didn’t connect your bank account to your tax return with the IRS, you’ll receive a paper check. Checks will take much longer than direct deposit.FAQHow do I update my direct deposit information with the IRS?Currently, there is no way to update your direct deposit with the IRS. During the last round of stimulus checks, the IRS had a tool to update bank account information. If they update the tool, we’ll let you know here.What if I owe money on my most recent tax return?The IRS will not recoup money from your stimulus payments to cover tax debt. You will receive all money you qualify for.Can I get a stimulus check even if I haven’t filed taxes recently?If you haven’t filed taxes recently because you made less than $12,200 or $24,400 as a married couple or your only income is social security, you will still get a stimulus check.Is the stimulus payment considered taxable income?No, the payment is not taxable income.Are college students eligible for a stimulus payment?Yes, students are eligible for stimulus payments as long as they meet the normal criteria.Can I receive a stimulus payment if I’m on Disability/Social Security?Yes. You’ll receive your payment through the same method you receive payment for those services.How can I get my stimulus payment fast with Varo?We want to help you access your payment as soon as possible. If you’re expecting a payment, we’ll post it right when we get it. As always, we don’t hold on to your deposits. We can tell you the second it hits your account with push notifications.

However, you could still end up with a negative balance if, for example, a transaction is approved for one amount, but then the actual charge is more than what you have in your account (like when you add a tip at a restaurant after the transaction for the meal was already approved). This could also include preauthorized ACH transfers that are scheduled, recurring and/or pending but have not yet settled. If your account balance remains negative, activity will be evaluated and your account could be closed. Even if you have a negative balance, we will not charge you an overdraft fee. 5There is no fee to withdraw money from any Allpoint® ATM. There is a $3.00 ATM cash withdrawal fee assessed by Varo Bank for all non-Allpoint® ATM transactions (out of network transactions).
