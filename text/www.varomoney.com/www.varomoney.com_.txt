1We will decline or return transactions when you do not have enough money in your account to cover the charge. However, you could still end up with a negative balance if, for example, a transaction is approved for one amount, but then the actual charge is more than what you have in your account (like when you add a tip at a restaurant after the transaction for the meal was already approved). This could also include preauthorized ACH transfers that are scheduled, recurring and/or pending but have not yet settled. If your account balance remains negative, activity will be evaluated and your account could be closed. Even if you have a negative balance, we will not charge you an overdraft fee.

2There is no fee to withdraw money from any Allpoint® ATM. There is a $3.00 ATM cash withdrawal fee assessed by Varo Bank for all non-Allpoint® ATM transactions (out of network transactions). The ATM operator may charge an additional fee.

3Message and data rates from your mobile service provider may apply.

4Individual offers may vary. Automatically get cash in your Varo Bank Account every time you reach $5 in cashback. Cashback available on specific items or services purchased with your Varo Debit Card and Varo Believe Card at select brands. Offer details may vary, see the Perks tab for more details and current deals. The maximum Cashback that can be earned is fifty dollars ($50 USD) per calendar month.

5We give you access to your direct deposits from employer and government payers on the day we receive them, which is typically up to 2 days earlier than your scheduled pay date.

6Varo Advance is a small dollar line of credit, which must be repaid.  Qualifications Apply. Advance customers start with $20 and if qualified, may step up gradually over time. For Advances over $20, your Advance repayment history, qualifying direct deposits, and any other qualifications will be reviewed daily to determine any change to your credit limit. Visit our website for more information.
