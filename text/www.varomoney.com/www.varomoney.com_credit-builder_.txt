1The Varo Believe Secured Credit Card is designed to help you build your credit; however, a variety of factors impact your credit including payment history, utilization, derogatory marks, account age, total number of accounts, and inquiries–not all factors are equally weighted. Building your credit may take time and is a process, but the Varo Believe Card may be able to help when you consistently make on-time payments.

2Your spending limit can’t exceed your available to spend balance in your Varo Believe Secured Account, up to $2,500 per day for purchases or $1,000 a day for cash advances, totaling no more than $10,000 total per billing cycle.


3By turning on Safe Pay, you authorize Varo Bank to automatically pay your monthly credit card statement at the end of your billing cycle from the money you previously added to your Varo Believe Secured Account, before your actual Payment Due Date. In the rare case that the amount you owe is greater than the amount in your Varo Believe Secured Account, your payment will not be made until you deposit the shortage into your secured account. You will have twenty-one (21) days to deposit the shortage into your secured account to make your Varo Believe Card payment on time.


4According to Nerdwallet, most secured credit cards require a deposit of $200 to $300.


5According to a recent analysis by Credit Karma, secured credit card APR can range up to ~23%.
