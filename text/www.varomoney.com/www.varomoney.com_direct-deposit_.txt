^A tax refund may only be direct deposited into an account that is in your name. This means that if you file a joint return, the name of the primary filer must match the name on the account. If a tax refund is directed to an account that is not in your name it may be rejected and returned to the IRS. No more than three electronic refunds can be deposited into a single financial account or prepaid card. If you exceed the limits stated here: https://www.irs.gov/individuals/direct-deposit-limits, you will receive notice from the IRS and a paper check refund.
