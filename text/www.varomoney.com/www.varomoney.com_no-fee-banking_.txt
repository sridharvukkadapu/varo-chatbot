All Rights Reserved*We will decline or return transactions when you do not have enough money in your account to cover the charge. However, you could still end up with a negative balance if, for example, a transaction is approved for one amount, but then the actual charge is more than what you have in your account (like when you add a tip at a restaurant after the transaction for the meal was already approved). This could also include preauthorized ACH transfers that are scheduled, recurring and/or pending but have not yet settled. If your account balance remains negative, activity will be evaluated and your account could be closed. Even if you have a negative balance, we will not charge you an overdraft fee.

**If you use a non-Allpoint network ATM, including a balance inquiry, you may be charged an additional fee by the ATM operator even if you don’t complete a withdrawal: such an additional fee is a third-party fee assessed by the individual ATM operator only and isn’t assessed by us. The ATM fee will be charged to your Varo Bank Account.
***Third party money transfer services used to add cash to your Bank Account may impose their own fees and limits (per transaction, daily, weekly or monthly) on the frequency or amount of cash you may deposit to the Bank Account.
****For Military personnel and their families that qualify as “covered borrowers” under 32 C.F.R. § 232.3(g) at the time of opening their Account, Varo will waive all fees charged per Advance. For more information about how we calculate fees, see the Varo Advance Account Agreement, available  here.
*****Late Payment Fees are not charged on any delinquencies where the amount of the delinquency is less than the amount of the Late Payment Fee. The Late Payment Fees are capped at three times the amount of the Late Payment Fee per delinquency state.
