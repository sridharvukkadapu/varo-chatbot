When looking for a savings account, you’ll want to find what’s called a “high-yield savings account.”
What is a high-yield savings account?
High-yield savings accounts are a type of savings account that pay a lot more than the national average rate. That means you’ll save more with a high-yield savings account than you would with a traditional savings account.
With a Varo Savings Account, you can qualify to earn 5.00% APY (on your balance up to $5,000).1 That’s one of the highest savings rates in the country.5

Whether you’re saving for your dream trip or building an emergency fund, earning $100 on a balance of $2,000 will help get you there faster than if you earn only $6.60 on that same balance. It’s easy money!
