Since money is sent directly from your Varo account to another person’s bank account within minutes, Zelle® should only be used to send money to friends, family, and others you trust.
If you don’t know the person, or aren’t sure you will get what you paid for (for example, items bought from an online bidding or sales site), you should not use Zelle®. These transactions are potentially high risk (just like sending cash to a person you don’t know is high risk).

To check whether the payment is still pending because the recipient hasn’t yet enrolled, you can go to your activity page, choose the payment you want to cancel and then select “Cancel This Payment.” If you do not see this option available, please contact us via Chat for assistance with cancelling the pending payment.
If the person you sent money to has already enrolled with Zelle®, the money is sent directly to their bank account and can’t be canceled.

If you sent money to the wrong person, we recommend contacting the recipient and requesting the money back. If you aren’t able to get your money back, please contact us via Chat from your Varo app so we can help you.
